DERIVATIO NOMINIS: The new species Howdeniola polleti sp. nov. is named
after its collector, dear colleague and renowned dipterist Dr. Marc Pollet (Brussels,
Belgium).

BIONOMY: Howdeniola polleti sp. nov. was collected in pan traps, these were
dug into the soil until their upper rim. The biome at the altitude of 2000 m a. s. 1. can
be considered as lower montane rainforest (written communication M. Pollet).

DISTRIBUTION: Howdeniola polleti sp. nov. represents the southernmost find of
the genus. Furthermore an undescribed Howdeniola was recorded from Costa Rica
