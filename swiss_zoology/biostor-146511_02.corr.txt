camera (Leica DFC425) under a stereomicroscope (Leica MZ16). The same camera
was used for the habitus pictures. The pictures are composites processed using the soft-
ware Imagic Image Access (Version 10) and then retouched using Adobe Photoshop
version 10.0.1 (Adobe Systems Incorporated). The body size was measured dorsally
from the apex of the elytra t0 the base of the rostrum.

DESCRIPTION: Habitus: Figs 1-2.

Size: 1.96 mm

Body colour: auburn, glossy.

Head, rostrum and antennae: Head (Fig. 3) globose, impunctate and glabrous,
abruptly different from rostrum. Eyes lacking. Rostrum about four times longer than
wide, elliptical in cross-section, dorsally sparsely punctate, epistoma glabrous and
impunctate, fore margin hanging over mouthparts. Scrobes latero—ventral, reaching to
the base. Antennal insertion bulged in dorsal View, antennae inserted at beginning of
apical third of rostrum. Antennal scape gradually enlarged, as long as funiculus.
Funiculus (Fig. 4) consisting of seven segments of following ratios (L/B): 1st: 1.25;
2nd: 0.9; 3rd: 0.6; 4th to 6th: 0.5; 7th: 2.0. Club oval, circular in cross-section, densely
clothed with long white setae, and sitting in the bowl-like 7th segment.

Pronotum: Index (L/B): 1.53. Longer than wide, strongly constricted after the
first third, widest after the middle. Surface deeply punctate with interspaces of about
the size of punctation. Short bright hairs arise from punctation.

Elytra: Index (L/B): 1.76. Base narrower than pronotum, oval, lacking humeral
callus (apterous), widest before the middle, tapered towards base and conical towards
apex. Eight deeply punctate striae, intervals including suture narrow, elevated and
costate with minute adherent hairs. Intervals (excluding suture) 3, 5, 6 and 7 are in—
complete, not reaching the elytral apex. Five sternites, of which 3 and 4 are equal,
stemite 5 rounded towards apex, deeply punctate with bowed hairs and slightly bulged
in the middle.

Legs: Coxae separated from each other as follows: procoxae by less than 1/2 of
their diameter, mesocoxae by 1/2 and metacoxae by two times of their diameter. Femora
unarmed, punctate, short adherent bright hairs arise. Tibiae punctate with short adher-
