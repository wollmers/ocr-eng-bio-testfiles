A new eyeless species of Howdeniola Osella, 1980 from Ecuador
(Coleoptera, Curculionidae). - Howdeniola polleti sp. nov. is described
from southern Ecuador. The fifth species of the Neotropic Howdeniola
Osella, 1980 represents the southernmost record of the genus, and the first
with no visible eye remnants. The single male specimen was caught in a pan
trap in the Podocarpus National Park at 2000 m a. s. l. in a lower montane
rainforest.

Keywords: Cossoninae - eyeless species - taxonomy - South America -
Podocarpus National Park - Ecuador.

INTRODUCTION

The genus Howdeniola Osella, 1980 was originally placed into Molytinae, later
Howden (1992) moved it to Cossoninae. Alonso-Zarazaga & Lyal (1999) listed
Howdeniola in the tribe Dryotribini Le Conte, 1876 together with the supposed closely
related Micromimus Wollaston, 1873.

Howdeniola comprises four hitherto described species, all with vestigial eyes:
H. nitidipennis Osella, 1980 and H. sulcipennis Osella, 1980 — both from Colombia —
and H. margheritae Belló & Osella, 2008 and H. onorei Belló & Osella, 2008 - both
from northern Ecuador - (Osella 1980, Belló & Osella 2008).

Within a biodiversity sampling project in Podocarpus National Park in Ecuador
a single male specimen of an eyeless weevil was caught. This specimen shows the
typical characters of Howdeniola which are modified and summarized after Osella
(1980) and Howden (1992) as follows: (I) fore margin of epistoma overhanging mouth-
parts, (II) impunctate head abruptly different from rostrum, (III) eyes reduced or
lacking, (IV) scrobe latero-ventral, reaching to or near base of rostrum, (V) seven
articulated funiculus of the antenna, (VI), conspicuously elongated tibial uncus at outer
angle, (VII) scutellum dorsally not visible, (VIII) basal margin of elytra elevated, (IX)
shiny integument of the body.

In the following Howdeniola polleti sp. nov. from southern Ecuador is
described.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The male genital structures were extracted and dry glued on the mounting card.
The genital structures were photographed beneath glycerol with a 5-megapixel digital
