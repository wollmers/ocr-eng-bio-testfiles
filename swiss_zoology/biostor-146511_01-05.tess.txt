A new eyeless species of Howdem'ola Osella, 1980 from Ecuador
(Coleoptera, Curculionidae). - Howdeniola polletz' sp. nov. is described
from southern Ecuador. The ﬁfth species of the Neotropic Howdeniola
Osella, 1980 represents the southernmost record of the genus, and the ﬁrst
with no Visible eye remnants. The single male specimen was caught in a pan
trap in the Podocarpus National Park at 2000 m a. s. l. in a lower montane
rainforest.

Keywords: Cossoninae - eyeless species - taxonomy - South America -
Podocarpus National Park - Ecuador.

INTRODUCTION

The genus Howdeniola Osella, 1980 was originally placed into Molytinae, later
Howden (1992) moved it to Cossoninae. Alonso-Zarazaga & Lyal (1999) listed
Howdeniola in the tribe Dryotribini Le Conte, 1876 together with the supposed closely
related Micromimus Wollaston, 1873.

Howdem'ola comprises four hitherto described species, all with vestigial eyes:
H. nitidipennis Osella, 1980 and H. sulcipennis Osella, 1980 — both from Colombia —
and H. margheritae Bello & Osella, 2008 and H. onorei Bello & Osella, 2008 , both
from northern Ecuador ~ (Osella 1980, Bello & Osella 2008).

Within a biodiversity sampling project in Podocarpus National Park in Ecuador
a single male specimen of an eyeless weevil was caught. This specimen shows the
typical characters of Howdeniola which are modified and summarized after Osella
(1980) and Howden (1992) as follows: (I) fore margin of epistoma overhanging mouth-
parts, (11) impunctate head abruptly different from rostrum, (III) eyes reduced or
lacking, (IV) scrobe latero-ventral, reaching to or near base of rostrum, (V) seven
articulated funiculus of the antenna, (VI), conspicuously elongated tibial uncus at outer
angle, (VII) scutellum dorsally not Visible, (VIII) basal margin of elytra elevated, (IX)
shiny integument of the body.

In the following Howdeniola polleti sp. nov. from southern Ecuador is
described.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The male genital structures were extracted and dry glued on the mounting card.
The genital structures were photographed beneath glycerol with a 5-megapixel digital

camera (Leica DFC425) under a stereomicroscope (Leica MZ16). The same camera
was used for the habitus pictures. The pictures are composites processed using the soft-
ware Imagic Image Access (Version 10) and then retouched using Adobe Photoshop
version 10.0.1 (Adobe Systems Incorporated). The body size was measured dorsally
from the apex of the elytra t0 the base of the rostrum.

REMARKS: The specimen was caught in a 5% formalin (= 2% formaldehyde)
ﬁxative solution with detergent in the traps, and then stored in 70% alcohol. The
specimen was treated with Pepsin solution for preparation of the genital organs. The
holotype specimen is deposited in the RBINS (Royal Belgian Institute of Natural
Sciences).

DESCRIPTION: Habitus: Figs 1-2.

Size: 1.96 mm

Body colour: auburn, glossy.

Head, rostrum and antennae: Head (Fig. 3) globose, impunctate and glabrous,
abruptly different from rostrum. Eyes lacking. Rostrum about four times longer than
wide, elliptical in cross-section, dorsally sparsely punctate, epistoma glabrous and
impunctate, fore margin hanging over mouthparts. Scrobes latero—ventral, reaching to
the base. Antennal insertion bulged in dorsal View, antennae inserted at beginning of
apical third of rostrum. Antennal scape gradually enlarged, as long as funiculus.
Funiculus (Fig. 4) consisting of seven segments of following ratios (L/B): 15‘: 1.25;
2nd: 0.9; 3“: 0.6; 4th to 6th: 0.5; 7th: 2.0. Club oval, circular in cross-section, densely
clothed with long white setae, and sitting in the bowl-like 7th segment.

Pronotum: Index (L/B): 1.53. Longer than wide, strongly constricted after the
first third, widest after the middle. Surface deeply punctate with interspaces of about
the size of punctation. Short bright hairs arise from punctation.

Elytra: Index (L/B): 1.76. Base narrower than pronotum, oval, lacking humeral
callus (apterous), widest before the middle, tapered towards base and conical towards
apex. Eight deeply punctate striae, intervals including suture narrow, elevated and
costate with minute adherent hairs. Intervals (excluding suture) 3, 5, 6 and 7 are in—
complete, not reaching the elytral apex. Five sternites, of which 3 and 4 are equal,
stemite 5 rounded towards apex, deeply punctate with bowed hairs and slightly bulged
in the middle.

Legs: Coxae separated from each other as follows: procoxae by less than 1/2 of
their diameter, mesocoxae by 1/2 and metacoxae by two times of their diameter. F emora
unarmed, punctate, short adherent bright hairs arise. Tibiae punctate with short adher-

ent bright hairs. Inner side of tibiae set with raised bright hairs, fore tibiae with densely
standing raised bristles from the middle on. Apex of tibiae with long curved uncus at
outer apical angle, and short tooth at inner angle. Tarsi with three well visible tarsal
segments, fourth very short. Claw segment as long as ﬁrst tarsal segment, claws minute
and simple.

Aedeagus (Figs 5-6): Apex of aedeagus asymmetrically pointed, ventrally hook-
like bowed. Median lobe containing a tubular sclerite diverging towards apophyses.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Howdem'ola polleti sp. nov. differs from all other
four above-mentioned members of the genus by the slender elytra with narrow and
costate intervals, the strongly constricted pronotum before its fore margin, and the
conspicuously pointed apex of the aedeagus.

DERIVATIO NOMINIS: The new species Howdeniola polleti sp. nov. is named
after its collector, dear colleague and renowned dipterist Dr. Marc Pollet (Brussels,
Belgium).

BIONOMY: Howdeniola polleti sp. nov. was collected in pan traps, these were
dug into the soil until their upper rim. The biome at the altitude of 2000 m a. s. 1. can
be considered as lower montane rainforest (written communication M. Pollet).

DISTRIBUTION: Howdem‘ola polleti Sp. nov. represents the southernmost ﬁnd of
the genus. Furthermore an undescribed Howdeniola was recorded from Costa Rica

(Rancho Quemado, Osa, Puntarenas, leg. F.A. Quesada, det. R. Anderson; record from
IABIN (Red Interamericana de Informacion sobre Biodiversidad)). These further
records obviously indicate that many more species of this genus will be discovered in
this large area.
